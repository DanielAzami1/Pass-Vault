# Pass-Vault
Pass-Vault Python Application

Pass-Vault is a desktop application designed to aid with the storage and creation of accounts. Modern consumers will have subscriptions and registrations with many different services concurrently (e.g. a Netflix subscription, bank accounts, student or work accounts, etc.) and may require centralized storage of this information to prevent mistakes. 

While this been executed more-or-less functionally, there is little to no actual security imposed by this application and so no one should ever store real information using Pass-Vault. Right now, it is as secure as a notepad file on your desktop. 

The program pulls most of its dependents from the source folder, and so may be difficult to run without errors on any arbitrary client machine. Furthermore, the scaling and resizing of the actualy GUI is likely to be very error-prone. 

To run the application in chronological format, start with the LoginWindow.pyw file. This should allow seamless transition between the three modules and various mini pop-ups. 

Also email verification is currently bugged.
