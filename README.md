# Pass-Vault
---
Pass-Vault is an older Python application (Windows OS) designed to act as a central *nexus* of user information pertaining to their various 
account-based subscriptions. The concept was brought about to eliminate the hassle of remembering an arbitrary number of secure (and thus complex)
sets of login info, instead storing that information in a central hub for ease of reference. The application features a crude GUI built using TKinter, as well as basic database querying.

Certain additionl functionality was included/attempted, such as email-verification, security-questions and captcha. The robustness and efficacy of any of these features is strictly open to interpretation.
